*** We learned about Global Fonts and Global Colors
** We learned about typeograpghy < Site Settings , to set specific attributes for particualr H1, H2, P for ex..
- but we have to disable fonts and colors fro, the settings page

With Typeography we can set global fonts/ styles/ colors to individual elements

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We've just learned how to create Global Fonts, Global Colors and Typeography.

Typeography is the process of assigning global attributes like font type, size, weight and equally of importance it assigns global font selections and global colors. So you can creative paternize the design of your website, proper engineering.

FIRST THING TO DO WITH WORDPRESS IS GO INTO THE SITE ASETTINGS AND BUILD GLOBAL COLORS, GLOBAL FONTS.
More importantly,  The Theme Style Menu
- creating thems for everything on your site!
* typeography, for individual elements, colors, font families, sizes, buttons, images

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Creating a Global Header
- Creating our menu in Appearance > menu settings > menu structure

Plugin : Elementor header & Footer plugin
- Appearance > elementor header and footer builder

We creates a global header by going into Appearance > Elementor Global heasder adn footer plugin > we made our global header, and learned we can add display rules, such as excluding certian pages from receiving such attributes.
- type of template: Header
- display on: display rules & exclusion rules
- post attributes : elementor full width

We are editing the main container so we selected the widgit and uinserted a 80/20 split container
- full width
- adding global colors 
- we put our logo in the first column, IMAGE SIZE SHOULD ALWAYS BE FULL, make a link too
- we put our nav bar in the 2nd column, we found this under Menu
*KEY HERE IS: we found these additional elementor add-ons by scrolling all the way down to the bottom of our site navigation/edit panel > our extension

* We now are using duplicator, to duplicate the global background we have and to change colors on the other pages we have excluded

JUST LEARNED A TON
- built a global header and used duplicator, which was under appearance > edit with duplicator

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BUILDING A GLOBAL FOOTER

* We added our global footer with duplicator, we went to appearance > heasder and footer plugin and created it it!
- some attributes we stuck to are width: elementor full, we didnt exclude any page 

~~~~~~~~~~~

Banner

- I gotta learn more about how to work with duplicator

Recap
- We've added our container image to and done a negative -270 margin top so it actually overlaps our home page nav bar header, that we created in appearance. 
- I had to go back into our elementor header, the globals, and go into the nav bar settings via the navigator and I just turned the background off on the nav bar, making it translucent
